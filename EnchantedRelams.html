<h1>Energy</h1>
<h2> Energy is the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, helectrical, chemical, nuclear, or other forms.

<p>In physics, energy is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed</p>
<p><b>What is the best definition energy?
Energy is defined as the ability to do work, which is the ability to exert a force causing displacement of an object. Despite this confusing definition, its meaning is very simple: energy is just the force that causes things to move. Energy is divided into two types: potential and kinetic.

Where does energy come from?
Our energy supply comes mainly from fossil fuels, with nuclear power and renewable sources rounding out the mix. These sources originate mostly in our local star, the Sun. Electricity falls into its own category because it's an energy carrier and not a primary source.

Why is energy so important?
Energy is so important in our daily lives because it is a basic human need. We use energy to not only heat our human-made structures but we use it to cool them as well. Energy is necessary for getting up out of bed, walking down the street, or even lifting your finger.

Why do we need energy?
Energy fuels your body's internal functions, repairs, builds and maintains cells and body tissues, and supports the external activities that enable you to interact with the physical world. Water, your body's most important nutrient, helps facilitate the chemical reactions that produce energy from food.

How do humans get energy?
Humans obtain energy from three classes of fuel molecules: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. The potential chemical energy of these molecules is transformed into other forms, such as thermal, kinetic, and other chemical forms.

What is energy formula?
Formula. The energy stored in an object due to its position and height is known as potential energy and is given by the formula: P.E. = mgh. Unit. The SI unit of energy is Joules (J).

What is energy and types of energy?
Energy exists in many different forms. Examples of these are: light energy, heat energy, mechanical energy, gravitational energy, electrical energy, sound energy, chemical energy, nuclear or atomic energy and so on. Each form can be converted or changed into the other forms.
