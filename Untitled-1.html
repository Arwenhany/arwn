<p>Kinetic energy is a form of energy that an object or a particle has by reason of its motion. If work, which transfers energy, is done on an object by applying a net force, the object speeds up and thereby gains kinetic energy.</p>

 What is kinetic energy and examples?
<p><b>Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, observable as the movement of an object, particle, or set of particles. Any object in motion is using kinetic energy: a person walking, a thrown baseball, a crumb falling from a table, and a charged particle in an electric field are all examples of kinetic energy at work.</b></p>

kinetic energy examples?
.13 Examples of Kinetic Energy in Everyday LifeHydropower Plants . Hydropower plants are places where the generation of electricity takes place with the help of water. Wind Mills.Moving Car.Bullet From a Gun.Flying Airplane. Walking & Running. Cycling.Rollercoasters.What is kinetic energy formula?
Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass of the object and to the square of its velocity: K.E. = 1/2 m v2.
 What is the best example of kinetic energy?
Anything at home that moves is an example of kinetic energy. This could be a cue ball rolling on a billiards table, a fan circulating air on a warm day, or glass shattering on the floor after it falls from the counter. Electrical devices that are turned on use kinetic energy as do people moving about the house.
What is the unit of kinetic energy?
Units of Kinetic Energy
The SI unit of kinetic energy is Joule which is equal to 1 kg. m2. s-2.
